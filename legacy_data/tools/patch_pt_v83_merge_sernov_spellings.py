patch_pt_v83_merge_sernov_spellings.py

Merge two duplicate person rows, "Ilija Sernov" and "Ilja Sernov", into the
established record "Ilya Sernov".

The three spellings are one player. All three appear at the same 2012 event, each
in a different discipline, so no discipline holds two of them; Ilya Sernov carries
the longest run of results, from 2011 to 2013; and an earlier verified alias
already resolves "Ilja Sernov" to Ilya Sernov. The maintainer ruled the pair the
character-loss check reported, Ilija and Ilja, the same player, and Ilya Sernov is
the survivor because it holds the most results. None of the three carries a legacy
account link.

Each doomed row owns one placement in the lock; it moves to the survivor. The
existing Ilja alias already resolves to the survivor and stays as it is; "Ilija
Sernov" gains an alias row. None of the three has a country override line, and the
differing countries the records show are left as they are.

Operations:
  Persons_Truth_Final.csv       survivor absorbs the doomed rows' player ids, and
                                gains their spellings in player_names_seen and
                                aliases_presentable; the doomed rows are deleted
  Placements_ByPerson.csv       the doomed person's own rows move to the survivor
  person_aliases.csv            alias rows naming a doomed id point at the
                                survivor; every doomed spelling gains an alias row
                                unless one already resolves to the survivor
  person_country_overrides.csv  each doomed row's line is deleted (none exist)

Each file is rewritten line by line: every other line is copied through byte for
byte. Every file is rewritten in memory and checked before any is written. A
second run stops on its pre-condition checks rather than compounding the edit;
checking out the four files is the rollback.
