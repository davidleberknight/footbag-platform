# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

This doc holds the accepted deviations from long-term design intent for bootstrapping, security follow-ups, and near-term sprint planning scope for AI. 
Long-term design: `docs/`. 
Sister IP for data prep: `legacy_data/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.

## When to add an entry here

Entries belong here ONLY if current code or infra deviates from canonical design (`docs/`) and a change is needed to close the gap. Go-live and cutover-readiness items go to `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (even if they are also in Design Decisions as a long-term intent). Documented future work and intentional development versus staging versus production asymmetries are not deviations.

## Accepted temporary deviations

1. **Readiness probe limited to SQLite + memory pressure.** SERVICE_CATALOG.md `OperationsPlatformService.checkReadiness()` composes the readiness signal for `/health/ready`. Current implementation probes SQLite and container memory pressure only; KMS, SES, and S3 backup health are not included.
