# IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

This file tracks the current build: active sprint, accepted dev shortcuts, and external blockers. Long-term design lives in `docs/USER_STORIES.md`, `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md`, and `docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`; anything narrower than those docs is implicit future work and is not enumerated here.

## Active slice now

### Parallel tracks

Two developers work in parallel. **AI assistants: read only the track section matching the active developer; other tracks are out-of-scope noise.** Identify the developer from the git user, the prompt, or by asking.

| Dev | Handle | Track | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dave | (primary maintainer) | normal maintenance | — |
| James | JamesLeberknight | Historical pipeline completion (data import / legacy migration) | "James's track" (routing only; detail in `legacy_data/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) |

Cross-track changes require explicit human coordination.

## James's track: Historical pipeline completion (parallel)

Tracked in `legacy_data/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. Load only when working in that subtree.

## Accepted temporary deviations

### Feature deviations

1. **Avatar pipeline is local-only.** No server-side processing; raw uploads stored as-is (Busboy streaming, 5 MB limit); stable path + `?v={media_id}` cache-bust. `PhotoStorageAdapter` boot-time/parity/staging-smoke trio still to complete for S3 impl. CloudFront `/media/*` custom cache policy keys on query string for the cache-bust; retire to `Managed-CachingOptimized` once content-hash filenames replace `?v=`. Unblock: S3/media pipeline.
